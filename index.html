      <h1>Why make this website</h1>
      <p>  Your zodiac sign can mean many things about who you are as a person and why. Maybe you'er just curious about what your zodiac means. I want people to be able to understand themselves and why they are them. When I found out what my zodiac meant I got interested in what the rest of them meant as well </p>
