      <h1>Why it's good to know?</h1>
      <p>Knowing your zodiac can open your mind up to many things. Your zodiac is who you are as a person.<br> Let your imagination go wild. There are so many things that aren't on my website that you could spend <br> hours reserching. It is one of the main reasons I have taken a liking towards this subject. There is so much <br> to just one zodiac sign. Everyone of them has their own meaing. Many meanings in fact, there is never <br> just one meaning. My website just states a couple possible traits for each one.  </p>
