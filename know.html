      <h1>Why it's good to know?</h1>
      <p>Knowing your zodiac can open your mind up to many things. Your zodiac is who you are as a person. Let your imagination go wild. There are so many things that aren't on my website that you could spend hours reserching. It is one of the main reasons I have taken a liking towards this subject. There is so much to just one zodiac sign. Everyone of them has their own meaing. Many meanings in fact, there is never just one meaning. My website just states a couple possible traits for each one.  </p>
